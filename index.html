<p style="font-size:30px">CORONA PRAYER</p>
"Lord i come before you this day, to thank you for
  The gift of life, thank you for your continued protection, and even about 
  Thi powerful day, it was not our plan Jehovah but you knew about this. 
  There is no one like you God you are beyond human understanding, 
  Lord forgive us our iniquities which has separated us from you, 
  Hold our hand o Lord for we are walking on the ways full of Satan traps, 
  Protect us from all the traps and shield us from evil weapons, 
  You send your son Jesus Christ to redeem us but we find ourselves 
  Deviating from you, 
  You know about the Corona  virus Lord, we know nothing about this 
  Protect us from this and heal them those who are infected,
  Jesus you was able to heal a man with leprosy, you are powerful 
  We submit everything unto you.. 
  The king of Kings safe our world from this encroaching disease 
  Lord take away this from us. 
  Where you are Lord Satan is powerless, destroy all the plans of the devil
  And let your will be done. 
  
  Amen"

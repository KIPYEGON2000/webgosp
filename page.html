  "When you go out to war against your enemies,
  and see horses and chariots and an army larger than your own,

  <h1>FASTING</h1>
"And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure 
 their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they
  have received their reward. But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face
  , That your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret
  . And your Father who sees in secret will reward you." </br></br>
